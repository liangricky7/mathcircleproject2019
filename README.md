Gambler's Ruin
=======================

This is a simulation where a Gambler flips a coin and based on its result, it designates it as a win or fail. 
In this project, we examine if a pattern can be deduced from the results given. Included is a three player rendition.

ORIGINAL GAMBLER'S RUIN
==================================

Our player begins with fifty dollars and has a fair coin (in this case a rng). If it lands tails, the player loses a coin and vice versa for heads. This continues for the given amount of simulations (n_simulations) or if the player goes broke in the given time. Once it ends, the player's balance history is then plotted as a line graph is displayed.

The rng is set at 0 - 99 since the odds of 50:50 can be changed by a user to make the games turn in or out of their favor.


THREE PLAYERS
====================

Included is a separate simulation where three players rolls a 6-sided die, and each pair of sides corresponds to a player, with the landing of that side declaring that player's win. Each player starts with ten dollars in their balance, with a win yielding a player two dollars and the rest a subtraction of a dollar. 

This continues until one player is knocked out and thus now three of the six sides are assigned to the remaining two players. They continue rolling with yield of one and loss of one until a winner emerges.
